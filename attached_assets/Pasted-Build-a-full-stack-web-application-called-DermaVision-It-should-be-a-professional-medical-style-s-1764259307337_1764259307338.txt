Build a full-stack web application called "DermaVision". It should be a professional medical-style skin disease assistant.

Requirements:
1. Authentication:
   - Signup & Login page for patients.
   - Collect: Patient ID, Name, Age, Gender, Email, Phone, City, Country.
   - After login, show a Dashboard.

2. Dashboard:
   - Welcome message with patient name.
   - Menu: Dashboard, Skin Scan, Search Disease Tips, History, Doctor Consult, Calendar, Profile.

3. Skin Scan (Camera & Upload):
   - Page with two options:
     a) Upload Image (for skin photo)
     b) Live Camera Capture (if browser supports)
   - Send the image to a fake AI analysis API endpoint.
   - Backend should simulate AI: based on image name or dummy rules, return:
       - Possible condition name (example: Acne, Eczema, Psoriasis, Melasma etc.)
       - Severity (Mild / Moderate / Severe)
       - Suggested medicine types ONLY (no strong prescriptions): 
         - Example: "Use mild cleanser", "Use sunscreen SPF 50", "Consult dermatologist for strong steroid creams, do not self-medicate."
   - Clearly show a banner: "This is NOT a real medical diagnosis. Please consult a certified dermatologist."

4. Search Disease Tips:
   - Simple search bar.
   - When user types disease name (e.g. 'acne', 'eczema'):
       - Show card with:
           - short description
           - causes
           - basic skincare tips for men
           - basic skincare tips for women
           - when to see a doctor.
   - Data can be static JSON on frontend or backend.

5. History:
   - Table of past scans:
       - Date & Time
       - Disease predicted
       - Severity
       - Note: "Result generated by AI simulator, not real diagnosis".

6. Doctor Consult:
   - Show a list of dummy dermatologists:
       - Name, City, Country, Specialization, Experience Years.
       - Some doctors in India specifically.
   - Option to:
       - Book Video Call (no real call, just store selected date & time).
       - Chat button → open simple chat screen (patient side only).
   - Chat screen:
       - Simple message bubbles.
       - Store chat history in memory or in a small database if easy.

7. Calendar:
   - Calendar page showing:
       - Upcoming appointments with doctors (from Doctor Consult booking).
       - Past visit history (just use data from History).
   - Click an appointment → open details: doctor name, date, time, notes.

8. Design / UI:
   - Very clean, professional, like a real health-tech startup.
   - Main colors: white background, teal/blue highlights.
   - Good spacing, cards, icons where possible.
   - Responsive: should look okay on desktop and mobile.

9. Technology:
   - Use a modern full-stack JavaScript setup.
   - Backend: Node.js + Express (REST API routes).
   - Frontend: React (single-page app) or clean HTML/CSS/JS if easier for Replit.
   - Keep code well-structured into components / routes / services.

10. Explaining Code:
   - Add comments in the code explaining important parts (authentication, API routes, frontend components).
   - Especially document:
       - How the skin analysis endpoint works (even if simulated).
       - How history is stored.
       - How appointments and calendar work.
